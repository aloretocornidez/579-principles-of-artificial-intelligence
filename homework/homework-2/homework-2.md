Solve this problem in the most efficient and optimal way.

Show the solutions, and how the solutions were obtained, specifically:

1. A heuristic is advised that you should explain in the material you hand in.

2. An efficient search algorithm is advised that you should explain (how it
   works)

3. Attach the code that your or generative AI has written for you or explain
   what off-the-shelf modules you have used.

To develop a heuristic for this problem space, we must first propose a measure
by which to judge the current state in relation to the goal state. My proposed
heuristic shall be to count all of the white tiles on the wrong side of each
black tile. For example, using BBWBWW, there are three white tiles to the right
of two black tiles and two white tiles to the right of one black tile, meaning
that $h(n) = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8$.

While this heuristic may not be monotonic, it is a more informed heuristic than
a simple breadth first search that only counts the out of place tiles in a given
system.

Using this grading method, we can begin an implementation of the heuristic.

Using the A\* algorithm grading method, we can set up the state space of our
system using the equation $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$ where $g(n)$ is the cost from the
state node to node $n$ and $h(n)$ is the estimate of the distance from the node
$n$ to the goal node.

There are 6 possible moves from any given state unless it is not possible. Let
us discuss the moves before beginning a state space search. We shall use a
neutral position that allows all moves to demonstrate: BBB_WWW

The 6 possible moves are:

1. Left tile moves to right: BB_BWWW
2. Right tile moves to left: BBBW_WW
3. Left tile hops over to right: B_BBWWW
4. Right tile hops over to left: BBBWW_W
5. Left tile hops over two tiles to right: \_BBBWWW
6. Right tile hops over two tiles to left: BBBWWW\_

Now that we have established the possible

After that, we can begin traversal of the solution space to find the optimal
solution for the given system:

Using the beginning state:

BBBWWW\_ ($f(n) = 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 9$)
